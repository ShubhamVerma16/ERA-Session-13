# ERA-SESSION12 PyTorch Lightning &amp; Gradio

HF Link: https://huggingface.co/spaces/RaviNaik/ERA-Session12

### Tasks:
1. :heavy_check_mark: Move your S10 assignment to Lightning first and then to Spaces such that: 
 - (You have retrained your model on Lightning) 
 - You are using Gradio 
2. :heavy_check_mark: Your spaces app has these features: 
 - ask the user whether he/she wants to see GradCAM images and how many, and from which layer, allow opacity change as well 
 - ask whether he/she wants to view misclassified images, and how many 
 - allow users to upload new images, as well as provide 10 example images 
 - ask how many top classes are to be shown (make sure the user cannot enter more than 10) 
 - Add the full details on what your App is doing to Spaces README  
3. :heavy_check_mark: Then:  
 - Submit the Spaces App Link 
 - Submit the Spaces README link (Space must not have a training code) 
 - Submit the GitHub Link where Lightning Code can be found along with detailed README with log, loss function graphs, and 10 misclassified images
